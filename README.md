# azure-tf-static-website
This is a simple terraform script to setup an azure static website with serverless function backend. The deployed website has fb and google trackers, provided as is for learning how to deploy cookie consent banner to block 3rd party user tracking. Only for learning purposes. See `src/clinic-website` for the static website, and `src/api` for azure serverless function backend apis (written in node v16). The fb tracker is in `src/clinic-website/js/tracker.js` and the google tracker code is embeded in `src/clinic-website/pages/header.html`. 

The script requires `terraform`, `az-cli` and `swa` commands installed on the machine. These can be installed with `pip` and `npm` respectively.

# Install and login to azure cli
